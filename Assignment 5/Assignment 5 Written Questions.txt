1. Give an example of two words that would hash to the same value using hashFunction1 but would not using hashFunction2. 

Any two words that contain the same letters such as "loop" and "pool "

2. Why does the above observation make hashFunction2 superior to hashFunction1?

hash function 2 accounts for order, thus minimizing the amount of links assigned to a single bucket.  This the function running closer to O(1).


3. When you run your program on the same input file once with hashFunction1 and once with hashFunction2, is it possible for your hashMapSize function to return different values?

no

4. When you run your program on the same input file once with hashFunction1 and once with hashFunction2, is it possible for your hashMapTableLoad function to return different values?

no

5. When you run your program on the same input file once with hashFunction1 and once with hashFunction2, is it possible for your hashMapEmptyBuckets function to return different values?

yes

6. Is there any difference in the number of empty buckets when you change the table size from an even number like 1000 to a prime like 997?

Yes, the prime number will produce fewer collisions and thus fewer assignments to the same bucket.  This in turn should lead to fewer empty buckets.
